This repository contains a collection of projects focused on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and basic machine learning using Pandas and other Python libraries.

Projects include:

* Animal adoption data analysis and prediction using regression and classification models

*  Handling missing values, data normalization, and unit conversions

* Immigration data visualization with Matplotlib

* Feature crafting and merging datasets (e.g., YouTube-like analytics)

* Grouping, aggregation, and working with dates

Each notebook demonstrates real-world scenarios and practical examples of working with structured data. Datasets are either created manually or taken from public sources such as Kaggle.
